# Git Repository Setup / WebGL Explorations

While exploring shadertoy, I found this example of WebGL usage called seascape: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Ms2SD1, its main purpose is to test GPU preformace.
I enjoyed this example because it reminded me of a yt video by two minute papers, in which the presenter covered a new method of simulating waves created by boats/objects. Its so crazy and stunning how realistic these water graphics are becoming, especially when compared to water effects used in video games I grew up playing.
